- 👋 Hi, I’m Ekin Şiar Bayer, I am a 16-year-old high school student. I don't have any plan to actively do a project until I enter university. Then I want to make a lot of projects with security content and publish them on Github
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber-security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more cyber-security, mostly web app security :)
- 📚 I want to learn more about digital forensics, reverse engineering, mobile app security and exploit development.
